= 3.0.3 (Unreleased)

* Support for has many through relationships. [jmeiss]

= 3.0.2

* FIX: Use Arel to get the data on lists. After moving to will_paginate I broke
  the data method, on each list we where "selecting ALL on the table of the
  current model" (Really ugly bug) [Reported by NateW]

* FIX: If @current_user was being set many times on each request, thanks to
  rails caching mechanism this was not affecting to the performance. Now we
  only se the @current_user once. (As it should be.)

= 3.0.1

* After moving from a vendored paginator to will_paginate I removed some stuff
  which shouldn't be removed, so the 3.0.0 gem is totally broken.

* Force query with postgresql adapter to not be case sensitive [jmeiss]

= 3.0.0

* New gem version compatible with Rails 3.

= Previously

Why a 3.0.0 version? After considering the work done for the Rails 3 transition
I though it would be a good idea to keep versions syncronized with Rails.

Typus will have the same version numbers as Rails as I considered it's pretty
tied to it. With each release of Rails, we will take the latest features into
Typus.

Pending stuff that someday will be done, donations and collaborations are
accepted.

* Add AJAX, specially when removing and adding new relationships.

* Transversal search and full models search.

* Test the helpers and add some functional testing.

* Nested models.

* Contextual content depending on the role logged.

* Replace typus authentication by devise.
