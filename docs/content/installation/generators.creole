= Generators

Once the gem is installed you need to run a generator to copy **Typus**
stylesheets, images and other required files into your application.

{{{
$ rails generate typus
}}}

By default **Typus** will not enable any authentication mechanism. If you want
to add {{{session}}} authentication you need to run a generator and migrate
your application database:

{{{
$ rails generate typus:migration
$ rake db:migrate
}}}

This generator creates a new model, {{{AdminUser}}} and adds some settings
which will be stored under {{{config/typus}}} folder. You can see some options
of this generator running the following command:

{{{
$ rails generate typus:migration -h
}}}

If you want to customize views you can copy default views to your application.

{{{
$ rails generate typus:views
}}}
