= Admin Panel for Ruby on Rails Applications

**Typus** is a control panel for [[http://rubyonrails.org/|Ruby on Rails]] 
applications to allow trusted users edit structured content. Itâ€™s not a CMS 
with a full working system but it provides a part of the system: 
authentication, permissions and basic look and feel for your websites control 
panel. So using [[http://rubyonrails.org/|Rails]] with **Typus** lets you 
concentrate on your application instead of the bits to manage the system.

**Typus** is the "old latin" word for **type** which stands for:

{{{
A category of people or things having common characteristics.
}}}

You can try a demo [[http://demo.typuscms.com/admin|here]].

<div class="important">
**Note**: Demo site has enabled the **typus_cms** module which is not
available for download (sorry, only the core is open source), but it's a good
example to show the things you can do with **Typus**.
</div>
